# Customer Segmentation Analysis
This repository contains project materials for the Spring 2024 STAT 208 class, specifically for Team 8. All materials are the property of Team 8, University of California, Riverside, A. Gary Anderson School of Management. Please do not republish the materials without authors' consents. 

## Introduction
For those who are new to this folder, the `Project-Code.ipynb` and `Project-Code.html` files are our main focus. This project is completed using **Python 3.12.0**. We are also attaching the documents which we will write for this project. The data is originally obtained from Kaggle.com, link will be attached below. Feel free to explore more options beyond this analysis report.

### Project Idea
This project is centered around Customer Segmentation analysis. We aim to provide better insights into customer behaviors and preferences to help businesses tailor their strategies effectively.

### Project Guideline
This project will follow the template.  
1. **`Section 1`**: Introduction / Why This Topic / Pre-analysis 
2. **`Section 2`**: Descriptive Analysis  
3. **`Section 3`**: Model Selection  
    - Part 1: Predictive Modeling
    - Part 2: Customer Segmentation Clustering
    - Part 3: Customer Segmentation Prediction (Classification)
    - Part 4: Feature Importance Analysis for Part 1 Predictive Modeling
4. **`Section 4`**: Business Insights / Suggestions
5. **`Section 5`**: Conclusion  

## Repository Contents
- **`Project-Code.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the code for our customer segmentation analysis.
- **`Project-Code.html`**: HTML export of the Jupyter notebook for easy viewing.
- **`Project-Proposals.pdf`**: Documents that report our initial ideas, studies, and finding before launching the analysis.
- **`Data Folder`**: Contains the datasets used for analysis. There are `train.csv` and `test.csv`. `train.csv` will be mainly used in descriptive analysis while `test.csv` will be mainly used in building models like predictive modeling. **Disclaimer**: The data is obtained from Kaggle.com [Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abisheksudarshan/customer-segmentation) published by Abishek Sudarshan. All data are used for educational purposes only. Do not republish original author Sudarshan's work without approval. License: Data files are copyrighted by the original authors.
- **`Final-Reports.pdf`**: Documentation and reports generated during the project.
